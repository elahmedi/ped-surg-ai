1,"Qian, 2023","Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a model combining a 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (<sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT)-based radiomics signature with clinical factors in the preoperative prediction of the International Neuroblastoma Pathology Classification (INPC) type of pediatric peripheral neuroblastic tumor (pNT). Method(s): A total of 106 consecutive pediatric pNT patients confirmed by pathology were retrospectively analyzed. Significant features determined by multivariate logistic regression were retained to establish a clinical model (C-model), which included clinical parameters and PET/CT radiographic features. A radiomics model (R-model) was constructed on the basis of PET and CT images. A semiautomatic method was used for segmenting regions of interest. A total of 1,016 radiomics features were extracted. Univariate analysis and the least absolute shrinkage selection operator were then used to select significant features. The C-model was combined with the R-model to establish a combination model (RC-model). The predictive performance was validated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) in both the training cohort and validation cohort. Result(s): The radiomics signature was constructed using 5 selected radiomics features. The RC-model, which was based on the 5 radiomics features and 3 clinical factors, showed better predictive performance compared with the C-model alone [area under the curve in the validation cohort: 0.908 vs. 0.803; accuracy: 0.903 vs. 0.710; sensitivity: 0.895 vs. 0.789; specificity: 0.917 vs. 0.583; net reclassification improvement (NRI) 0.439, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1047-0.773; P=0.01]. The calibration curve showed that the RC-model had goodness of fit, and DCA confirmed its clinical utility. Conclusion(s): In this preliminary single-center retrospective study, an R-model based on <sup>18</sup>F-FDG PET/CT was shown to be promising in predicting INPC type in pediatric pNT, allowing for the noninvasive prediction of INPC and assisting in therapeutic strategies.

2,"Pepi, 2023","Objectives: Hemispherotomy (HT) is a surgical option for treatment of drug-resistant seizures due to hemispheric structural lesions. Factors affecting seizure outcome have not been fully clarified. In our study, we used a brain Machine Learning (ML) approach to evaluate the possible role of Inter-hemispheric EEG Connectivity (IC) in predicting post-surgical seizure outcome. Methods: We collected 21 pediatric patients with drug-resistant epilepsy; who underwent HT in our center from 2009 to 2020; with a follow-up of at least two years. We selected 5-s windows of wakefulness and sleep pre-surgical EEG and we trained Artificial Neuronal Network (ANN) to estimate epilepsy outcome. We extracted EEG features as input data and selected the ANN with best accuracy. Results: Among 21 patients, 15 (71%) were seizure and drug-free at last follow-up. ANN showed 73.3% of accuracy, with 85% of seizure free and 40% of non-seizure free patients appropriately classified. Conclusions: The accuracy level that we reached supports the hypothesis that pre-surgical EEG features may have the potential to predict epilepsy outcome after HT.

3,"Luo, 2023","BACKGROUND: Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is a major complication following pediatric cardiac surgery, which is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The early prediction of CSA-AKI before and immediately after surgery could significantly improve the implementation of preventive and therapeutic strategies during the perioperative periods. However, there is limited clinical information on how to identify pediatric patients at high risk of CSA-AKI. OBJECTIVE: The study aims to develop and validate machine learning models to predict the development of CSA-AKI in the pediatric population. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study enrolled patients aged 1 month to 18 years who underwent cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass at 3 medical centers of Central South University in China. CSA-AKI was defined according to the 2012 Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria. Feature selection was applied separately to 2 data sets: the preoperative data set and the combined preoperative and intraoperative data set. Multiple machine learning algorithms were tested, including K-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes, support vector machines, random forest, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and neural networks. The best performing model was identified in cross-validation by using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Model interpretations were generated using the Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method. RESULTS: A total of 3278 patients from one of the centers were used for model derivation, while 585 patients from another 2 centers served as the external validation cohort. CSA-AKI occurred in 564 (17.2%) patients in the derivation cohort and 51 (8.7%) patients in the external validation cohort. Among the considered machine learning models, the XGBoost models achieved the best predictive performance in cross-validation. The AUROC of the XGBoost model using only the preoperative variables was 0.890 (95% CI 0.876-0.906) in the derivation cohort and 0.857 (95% CI 0.800-0.903) in the external validation cohort. When the intraoperative variables were included, the AUROC increased to 0.912 (95% CI 0.899-0.924) and 0.889 (95% CI 0.844-0.920) in the 2 cohorts, respectively. The SHAP method revealed that baseline serum creatinine level, perfusion time, body length, operation time, and intraoperative blood loss were the top 5 predictors of CSA-AKI. CONCLUSIONS: The interpretable XGBoost models provide practical tools for the early prediction of CSA-AKI, which are valuable for risk stratification and perioperative management of pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery.",Ensemble learner,Extreme Gradient Boosting,Adverse Event Prediction,Cardiac Surgery,Acute kidney injury,3863,12.999,0.479,0.889,0.9209,0.804,0.805,0.53102,0.804,0.283,0.977,0.6534,External,Yes,Low,Yes,China,Multicenter,-0.102669272,1.030369355,0,Prospective,https://dx.doi.org/10.2196/41142,
4,"Bakhuis, 2023","OBJECTIVES: When surgical resection is indicated for a congenital lung abnormality, lobectomy is often preferred over segmentectomy, mostly because the latter is associated with more residual disease. Presumably, this occurs in children because sublobar surgery often does not adhere to anatomical borders (wedge resection instead of segmentectomy), thus increasing the risk of residual disease. This study investigated the feasibility of identifying eligible cases for anatomical segmentectomy by combining virtual reality and artificial intelligence. METHODS: Semi-automated segmentation of bronchovascular structures and lesions were visualized with virtual reality and artificial intelligence technology. Two specialists independently evaluated via a questionnaire the informative value of regular computed tomography versus three-dimensional-virtual reality images. RESULTS: Five asymptomatic, non-operated cases were selected. Bronchovascular segmentation, volume calculation, and image visualization in the VR environment was successful in all cases. Based on the computed tomography images, assignment of the congenital lung abnormality lesion to specific lung segments matched between the consulted specialists in only one out of the cases. Based on the three three-dimensional-virtual reality images, however, the localization matched in three of the five cases. If the patients would have been operated, adding the three-dimensional-virtual reality tool to the pre-operative workup would have resulted in changing the surgical strategy (i.e., lobectomy versus segmentectomy) in four cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the technical feasibility of a hybridized artificial intelligence -virtual reality visualization of segment-level lung anatomy in patients with congenital lung abnormalities.

With the advanced management strategy, the global salvage and overall survival have significantly improved, which proposes subsequent challenges regarding long-term surveillance and offspring screening. Here, we developed deep learning algorithm, called Deep Learning Assistant for Retinoblastoma (DLA-RB) training on A total of 36623 images from 713 patients. We validated it in the prospectively collected dataset, comprised of 1366 images form 139 eyes of 103 patients. In identifying active retinoblastoma tumors (treatment required) from all clinical-suspected patients, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of DLA-RB reached 0.991 (95% CI 0.970-1.000). In identifying active retinoblastoma from stable retinoblastoma patients (treatment is not required), AUC of DLA-RB reached 0.962 (95% CI 0.915-1.000), respectively. Cost-utility analysis revealed that DLA-RB based diagnosis mode is more cost-effective in both retinoblastoma diagnosis and retinoblastoma activity surveillance. The DLA-RB achieved high accuracy and sensitivity in identifying active retinoblastoma from the normal and stable retinoblastoma fundus.

7,"Zhang, 2022: Mucoepidermoid tumors","INTRODUCTION: Medulloblastoma (MB), pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), and ependymoma (EP) compose the majority of posterior fossa (PF) pediatric tumors and share similar features on MRI. Pre-operative anticipation of pathology can inform the surgical approach, extent of resection, and potential complications. METHOD(S): We extracted 1800 Image features from T2- and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images in a multinational cohort of 274 MB, 156 PA, and 97 EP. We designed a two-step classifier-first ruling out PA with a three-way classifier, and next distinguishing MB from EP with a binary classifier. For each step, we selected the best performing classifier model from six candidates following LASSO-feature reduction. Final multi-class classifier performance was measured on a holdout test set with the micro-averaged F1-score. RESULT(S): Optimal diagnostic performance was achieved using two decision steps, each with their respective feature set and classifier method. An initial three-way (MB, PA, and EP) logistic regression classifier exhibited a micro-averaged F1-score of 0.739. From a reduced feature set of 61 features, T2-Uniformity and T1-Contrast were the most relevant for distinguishing PA. A subsequent two-way neural net classifier distinguished MB from EP with F1-score 0.9189. In the second reduced feature set of 39 features, T2-Sphericity and T1-Flatness were most relevant. Performing the two classifiers sequentially for MB, PA, and EP classification produced a micro-averaged F1-score of 0.9179. CONCLUSION(S): A sequential radiomic improved upon a single-step radiographic classifier for pediatric PF tumors. Strong overlap between MB and EP prevented a single-step classifier from distinguishing all three pathologies at once.

8,"Zeng, 2022","OBJECTIVE: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after pediatric cardiac surgery, and the early detection of AKI may allow for timely preventive or therapeutic measures. However, current AKI prediction researches pay less attention to time information among time-series clinical data and model building strategies that meet complex clinical application scenario. This study aims to develop and validate a model for predicting postoperative AKI that operates sequentially over individual time-series clinical data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 3386 pediatric patients extracted from PIC database was used for training, calibrating, and testing purposes. A time-aware deep learning model was developed and evaluated from 3 clinical perspectives that use different data collection windows and prediction windows to answer different AKI prediction questions encountered in clinical practice. We compared our model with existing state-of-the-art models from 3 clinical perspectives using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (PR AUC). RESULTS: Our proposed model significantly outperformed the existing state-of-the-art models with an improved average performance for any AKI prediction from the 3 evaluation perspectives. This model predicted 91% of all AKI episodes using data collected at 24 h after surgery, resulting in a ROC AUC of 0.908 and a PR AUC of 0.898. On average, our model predicted 83% of all AKI episodes that occurred within the different time windows in the 3 evaluation perspectives. The calibration performance of the proposed model was substantially higher than the existing state-of-the-art models.

9,"You, 2022","Sagittal craniosynostosis (CSO) occurs when the sagittal suture of a growing child's skull is fused prematurely. Surgery, which involves re-moving the affected bones and increasing the volume of the cranium by repositioning the bone segments or using external forces to guide, is the primary treatment for CSO. For preparation of the surgery, physicians usually classify sagittal CSO subtypes by examining the reconstruction of skulls from CT images or the laser scans of the patients' 3D skull. We have proposed an automated sagittal CSO classification algorithm based on features extracted from projected 3D skull images. However, these features would become invalid if they were extracted from irregular skulls or skulls with completely closed sutures. In order to tackle this problem, we proposed a 3D skull multi-view images-based algorithm to classify the subtypes of sagittal CSO, like the physicians diagnosing these 3D reconstruction images of skulls or laser scans. Our innovations include: 1) the first to propose a multi-view learning algorithm to classify the subtypes of sagittal CSO cases, 2) 3D rendering and a patch-based erosion method are adopted for data augmentation to keep the original ratio and shape of the images, and 3) utilizing a transfer leaning training strategy to train the convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multi-view-based prediction strategy for classifying the cases.",Neural network,CNN,Diagnosis,Neurosurgery,Craniosynostosis (CT),180,7.381333333,0.24,,0.85,0.91068,0.91579,0.89185,0.90198,0.93917,0.94156,0.8749,Internal,Yes,Low,Yes,USA,Hospital,-0.214123317,0.176644298,Radiology,Retrospective review,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00521-022-07310-5,Paywall
10,"Yahara, 2022","BACKGROUND: Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a three-dimensional spinal deformity that predominantly occurs in girls. While skeletal growth and maturation influence the development of AIS, accurate prediction of curve progression remains difficult because the prognosis for deformity differs among individuals. The purpose of this study is to develop a new diagnostic platform using a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) that can predict the risk of scoliosis progression in patients with AIS. METHODS: Fifty-eight patients with AIS (49 females and 9 males; mean age: 12.5 +/- 1.4 years) and a Cobb angle between 10 and 25 degrees (mean angle: 18.7 +/- 4.5) were divided into two groups: those whose Cobb angle increased by more than 10 degrees within two years (progression group, 28 patients) and those whose Cobb angle changed by less than 5 degrees (non-progression group, 30 patients). The X-ray images of three regions of interest (ROIs) (lung [ROI1], abdomen [ROI2], and total spine [ROI3]), were used as the source data for learning and prediction. Five spine surgeons also predicted the progression of scoliosis by reading the X-rays in a blinded manner. RESULTS: The prediction performance of the DCNN for AIS curve progression showed an accuracy of 69% and an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.70 using ROI3 images, whereas the diagnostic performance of the spine surgeons showed inferior at 47%.

12,"Sughimoto, 2022","BACKGROUND: Although serum lactate levels are widely accepted markers of haemodynamic instability, an alternative method to evaluate haemodynamic stability/instability continuously and non-invasively may assist in improving the standard of patient care. We hypothesise that blood lactate in paediatric ICU patients can be predicted using machine learning applied to arterial waveforms and perioperative characteristics. METHODS: Forty-eight post-operative children, median age 4 months (2.9-11.8 interquartile range), mean baseline heart rate of 131 beats per minute (range 33-197), mean lactate level at admission of 22.3 mg/dL (range 6.3-71.1), were included. Morphological arterial waveform characteristics were acquired and analysed. Predicting lactate levels was accomplished using regression-based supervised learning algorithms, evaluated with hold-out cross-validation, including, basing prediction on the currently acquired physiological measurements along with those acquired at admission, as well as adding the most recent lactate measurement and the time since that measurement as prediction parameters. Algorithms were assessed with mean absolute error, the average of the absolute differences between actual and predicted lactate concentrations. Low values represent superior model performance.

14,"Sikidar, 2022","At early stages, adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is quite hard to be distinguished from healthy (HC) subjects by the naked eye. AIS demands multiple corrective surgeries when detected later, thereby causing significant physical and psychological trauma as no mathematical models exist for the classification of mild AIS (MS) (20degree < Cobb's angle < 40degree) from HC, we propose a k-nearest neighbour (kNN) method based model. In this work, we collected both the EMG and GRF data from nine severe AIS (SS), three MS and four female HC during gait. Delayed muscle activation in Erector spinatus Iliocostalis, Gluteus Medius and Gastrocnemius lateralis was observed in SS compared to HC. However, no such distinction was noticed between MS and HC motivating for a mathematical model. Eighteen time-domain and nine frequency-domain features were computed from the EMG data of 14 lower extremity muscles, while five time-domain features were calculated from GRF data during gait. Out of all the features computed for each subject, the principal component analysis (PCA) yielded 15 principal components that coupled both time and frequency domains (TFD). Further, the kNN model classified SS, MS and HC from each other by these 15 TFD features. The model was trained and validated using 32 and 21 EMG and GRF data datasets during gait, respectively. The classification and validation accuracy of 90.6% and 85.7% were obtained among SS, MS and HC. The proposed model is capable of early detection of AIS and can be used by medical professionals to plan treatments and corrective measures.

Two previous studies have aimed to preoperatively predict pCMS, with varying results. In this work, we examine the generalization of these models and determine if pCMS can be predicted more accurately using an artificial neural network (ANN). METHODS: An overview of reviews was performed to identify risk factors for pCMS, and a retrospective dataset was collected as per these defined risk factors from children undergoing resection of primary posterior fossa tumors. The ANN was trained on this dataset and its performance was evaluated in comparison to logistic regression and other predictive indices via analysis of receiver operator characteristic curves. The area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated and compared using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test, with P < .05 considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Two hundred and four children were included, of whom 80 developed pCMS. The performance of the ANN (AUC 0.949; accuracy 90.9%) exceeded that of logistic regression (P < .05) and both external models (P < .001).

16,"Shih, 2022","Purpose 18F-FDG PET is widely used in epilepsy surgery. We established a robust quantitative algorithm for the lateralization of epileptogenic foci and examined the value of machine learning of 18F-FDG PET data in medial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) patients. Patients and Methods We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent surgery for MTLE. Three clinicians identified the side of MTLE epileptogenesis by visual inspection. The surgical side was set as the epileptogenic side. Two parcellation paradigms and corresponding atlases (Automated Anatomical Labeling and FreeSurfer aparc + aseg) were used to extract the normalized PET uptake of the regions of interest (ROIs). The lateralization index of the MTLE-associated regions in either hemisphere was calculated. The lateralization indices of each ROI were subjected for machine learning to establish the model for classifying the side of MTLE epileptogenesis. Result Ninety-three patients were enrolled for training and validation, and another 11 patients were used for testing. The hit rate of lateralization by visual analysis was 75.3%. Among the 23 patients whose MTLE side of epileptogenesis was incorrectly determined or for whom no conclusion was reached by visual analysis, the Automated Anatomical Labeling and aparc + aseg parcellated the associated ROIs on the correctly lateralized MTLE side in 100.0% and 82.6%. In the testing set, lateralization accuracy was 100% in the 2 paradigms. Conclusions Visual analysis of 18F-FDG PET to lateralize MTLE epileptogenesis showed a lower hit rate compared with machine-assisted interpretation. While reviewing 18F-FDG PET images of MTLE patients, considering the regions associated with MTLE resulted in better performance than limiting analysis to hippocampal regions.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models to predict the malnutrition status of children with CHD. We used explainable ML methods to provide insight into the model's predictions and outcomes. METHODS: This prospective cohort study included consecutive children with CHD admitted to the hospital from December 2017 to May 2020. The cohort data were divided into the training and test data sets based on the follow-up time. The outcome of the study was CHD child malnutrition 1 year after surgery, the primary outcome was an underweight status, and the secondary outcomes were stunted and wasting status. We used five ML algorithms with multiple features to construct prediction models, and the performance of these ML models was measured by an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) analysis. We also used the permutation importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to determine the importance of the selected features and interpret the ML models. RESULTS: We enrolled 536 children with CHD who underwent complete repair. The proportions of children with an underweight, stunted, or wasting status 1 year after surgery were 18.1% (97/536), 12.1% (65/536), and 17.5% (94/536), respectively. All patients contributed to the generation of 115 useable features, which allowed us to build models to predict malnutrition. Five prediction algorithms were used, and the XGBoost model achieved the greatest AUC in all outcomes. The results obtained from the permutation importance and SHAP analyses showed that the 1-month postoperative WAZ-score, discharge WAZ score and preoperative WAZ score were the top 3 important features in predicting an underweight status in the XGBoost algorithm. Regarding the stunted status, the top 3 important features were the 1-month postoperative HAZ score, discharge HAZ score, and aortic clamping time. Regarding the wasting status, the top 3 important features were the hospital length of stay, formula intake, and discharge WHZ-score. We also used a narrative case report as an example to describe the clinical manifestations and predicted the primary outcomes of two children. CONCLUSIONS: We developed an ML model (XGBoost) that provides accurate early predictions of malnutrition 1-year postoperatively in children with CHD.

However, some patients may suffer from pulmonary venous obstruction (PVO) after surgery with insufficient blood supply, necessitating special follow-up strategy and treatment. Therefore, it is a clinically important yet challenging problem to predict such patients before surgery. In this paper, we address this issue and propose a computational framework to determine the risk factors for postoperative PVO (PPVO) from computed tomography angiography (CTA) images and build the PPVO risk prediction model. From clinical experiences, such risk factors are likely from the left atrium (LA) and pulmonary vein (PV) of the patient. Thus, 3D models of LA and PV are first reconstructed from low-dose CTA images. Then, a feature pool is built by computing different morphological features from 3D models of LA and PV, and the coupling spatial features of LA and PV. Finally, four risk factors are identified from the feature pool using the machine learning techniques, followed by a risk prediction model. As a result, not only PPVO patients can be effectively predicted but also qualitative risk factors reported in the literature can now be quantified.

Compared to other standard models, we have tried to develop a prognostic multi-layer perceptron model based on potentially high-impact new variables for predicting the ETV success score (ETVSS). METHODS: Clinical and radiological data of 128 patients have been collected, and ETV outcomes were evaluated. The success of ETV was defined as remission of symptoms and not requiring VPS for six months after surgery. Several clinical and radiological features have been used to construct the model. Then the Binary Gravitational Search algorithm was applied to extract the best set of features. Finally, two models were created based on these features, multi-layer perceptron, and logistic regression. RESULTS: Eight variables have been selected (age, callosal angle, bifrontal angle, bicaudate index, subdural hygroma, temporal horn width, third ventricle width, frontal horn width). The neural network model was constructed upon the selected features. The result was AUC:0.913 and accuracy:0.859. Then the BGSA algorithm removed half of the features, and the remaining (Age, Temporal horn width, Bifrontal angle, Frontal horn width) were applied to construct models.

Method(s): A total of 118 patients with WT, who underwent contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans in our center between 2014 and 2021, were studied retrospectively and divided into two groups: stage I and non-stage I disease. Patients were randomly divided into training cohorts (n = 94) and test cohorts (n = 24). A total of 1,781 radiomic features from seven feature classes were extracted from preoperative portal venous-phase images of abdominal CT. Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to handle imbalanced datasets, followed by a t-test and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regularization for feature selection. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was deployed using the selected informative features to develop the predicting model. The performance of the model was evaluated according to its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was also arranged to assess the model performance.

Cross-validated AUC on the training dataset was 0.79 with a 95 percent confidence interval (CI) of 0.773-0.815 and a coefficient of variation of 3.76%, while AUC on the test dataset was 0.81, and accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.79, 0.87, and 0.69, respectively. Conclusion(s): The machine learning model of SVM based on radiomic features extracted from CT images accurately predicted WT stage I and non-stage I disease in pediatric patients preoperatively, which provided a rapid and non-invasive way for investigation of WT stages.

28,"Lu, 2022","Cochlear nerve deficiency (CND) is often associated with variable outcomes of cochlear implantation (CI). We assessed previous investigations aiming to identify the main factors that determine CI outcomes, which would enable us to develop predictive models. Seventy patients with CND and normal cochlea who underwent CI surgery were retrospectively examined. First, using a data-driven approach, we collected demographic information, radiographic measurements, audiological findings, and audition and speech assessments. Next, CI outcomes were evaluated based on the scores obtained after 2 years of CI from the Categories of Auditory Performance index, Speech Intelligibility Rating, Infant/Toddler Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale or Meaningful Auditory Integration Scale, and Meaningful Use of Speech Scale. Then, we measured and averaged the audiological and radiographic characteristics of the patients to form feature vectors, adopting a multivariate feature selection method, called stability selection, to select the features that were consistent within a certain range of model parameters. Stability selection analysis identified two out of six characteristics, namely the vestibulocochlear nerve (VCN) area and the number of nerve bundles, which played an important role in predicting the hearing and speech rehabilitation results of CND patients. Finally, we used a parameter-optimized support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier to study the postoperative hearing and speech rehabilitation of the patients. For hearing rehabilitation, the accuracy rate was 71% for both the SVM classification and the area under the curve (AUC), whereas for speech rehabilitation, the accuracy rate for SVM classification and AUC was 93% and 94%, respectively. Our results identified that a greater number of nerve bundles and a larger VCN area were associated with better CI outcomes. The number of nerve bundles and VCN area can predict CI outcomes in patients with CND. These findings can help surgeons in selecting the side for CI and provide reasonable expectations for the outcomes of CI surgery.",SVM,SVM,Surgical Outcome Prediction,OHNS,Persistent hearing impairment,70,2.275833333,0.4714,0.94,0.93,0.94387,0.96141,0.88144,0.9388,0.9134,0.8602,0.93,Cross-validation,No,High,Yes,China,Hospital,-0.21745211,-0.599246037,0,Retrospective review,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2022.895560,Paywall
29,"Liu, 2022","OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of adenotonsillectomy on OSAS symptoms based on a data-driven approach and thereby identify criteria that may help avoid unnecessary surgery in children with OSAS. METHODS: In 323 children enrolled in the Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial, randomised to undergo either early adenotonsillectomy (eAT; N = 165) or a strategy of watchful waiting with supportive care (WWSC; N = 158), the apnea-hypopnea index, heart period pattern dynamics, and thoraco-abdominal asynchrony measurements from overnight polysomnography (PSG) were measured. Using machine learning, all children were classified into one of two different clusters based on those features. The cluster transitions between follow-up and baseline PSG were investigated for each to predict those children who recovered spontaneously, following surgery and those who did not benefit from surgery. RESULTS: The two clusters showed significant differences in OSAS symptoms, where children assigned in cluster A had fewer physiological and neurophysiological symptoms than cluster B. Whilst the majority of children were assigned to cluster A, those children who underwent surgery were more likely to stay in cluster A after seven months. Those children who were in cluster B at baseline PSG were more likely to have their symptoms reversed via surgery. Children who were assigned to cluster B at both baseline and 7 months after surgery had significantly higher end-tidal carbon dioxide at baseline. Children who spontaneously changed from cluster B to A presented highly problematic ratings in behaviour and emotional regulation at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: Data-driven analysis demonstrated that AT helps to reverse and to prevent the worsening of the pathophysiological symptoms in children with OSAS. Multiple pathophysiological markers used with machine learning can capture more comprehensive information on childhood OSAS. Children with mild physiological and neurophysiological symptoms could avoid AT, and children who have UAO symptoms post AT may have sleep-related hypoventilation disease which requires further investigation. Furthermore, the findings may help surgeons more accurately predict children on whom they should perform AT.",KNN,KNN,Decision Support,General Surgery,Patient selection: adenotonsilectomy,323,2.872542922,0.467007692,0.8215,0.6698,0.6451,0.7852,0.5934,0.6199,0.789,0.7499,0.6288,None,No,High,Yes,USA,Hospital,-0.209795886,-0.508563205,0,Prospective,https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11325-021-02425-w,Paywall

The pressure recording analytical method (PRAM) is a minimally invasive system for continuous hemodynamic monitoring. To evaluate the postoperative prognosis, our study explored the predictive value of hemodynamic management for the duration of mechanical ventilation (DMV). Methods: This retrospective study included 60 infants who underwent cardiac surgery. Cardiac index (CI), the maximal slope of systolic upstroke (dp/dt<sub>max</sub>), and cardiac cycle efficiency (CCE) derived from PRAM were documented in each patient 0, 4, 8, and 12 h (T0, T1, T2, T3, and T4, respectively) after their admission to the intensive care unit (ICU). A linear mixed model was used to deal with the hemodynamic data. Correlation analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), and a XGBoost machine learning model were used to find the key factors for prediction. Results: Linear mixed model revealed time and group effect in CI and dp/dt<sub>max</sub>. Prolonged DMV also have negative correlations with age, weight, CI at and dp/dt<sub>max</sub> at T2. dp/dt<sub>max</sub> outweighing CI was the strongest predictor (AUC of ROC: 0.978 vs. 0.811, p < 0.01).

Even after the acute phase, posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus is a long-term complication, frequently requiring permanent ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement. Currently, there are no risk classification methods integrating the constellation of clinical data to predict short- and long-term prognosis in neonatal IVH. To address this need, the authors developed a two-part machine learning approach for predicting short- and long-term outcomes after diagnosis of neonatal IVH. Integrating both maternal and neonatal characteristics, they developed a binary classifier to predict short-term mortality risk and a clinical scale to predict the long-term risk of VPS placement. METHODS: Neonates with IVH were identified from the Optum Clinformatics Data Mart administrative claims database. Matched maternal and childbirth characteristics were obtained for all patients. The primary endpoints of interest were short-term (30 day) mortality and long-term VPS placement. Classification of short-term mortality risk was evaluated using 5 different machine learning approaches and the best-performing method was validated using a withheld validation subset. Prediction of long-term shunt risk was performed using a multivariable Cox regression model with stepwise variable selection, which was subsequently converted to an easily applied integer risk scale. RESULTS: A total of 5926 neonates with IVH were identified. Most patients were born before 32 weeks' gestation (67.2%) and with low birth weight (81.2%). Empirical 30-day mortality risk was 10.9% across all IVH grades and highest among grade IV IVH (34.3%). Among the neonates who survived > 30 days, actuarial 12-month postdiagnosis risk of shunt placement was 5.4% across all IVH grades and 31.3% for grade IV IVH. The optimal short-term risk classifier was a random forest model achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.882 with important predictors ranging from gestational age to diverse comorbid medical conditions. Selected features for long-term shunt risk stratification were IVH grade, respiratory distress syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and maternal preeclampsia or eclampsia. An integer risk scale, termed the Shunt Prediction After IVH in Neonates (SPAIN) scale, was developed from these 4 features, which, evaluated on withheld cases, demonstrated improved risk stratification compared with IVH grade alone (Harrell's concordance index 0.869 vs 0.852). CONCLUSIONS: In a large cohort of neonates with IVH, the authors developed a two-pronged, integrated, risk classification approach to anticipate short-term mortality and long-term shunt risk.

While maximal safe resection of tumors is desired, it can be challenging to differentiate normal brain from neoplastic tissue using only microscopic visualization, intraoperative navigation, and tactile feedback. Here, we investigate the potential for Raman spectroscopy (RS) to accurately diagnose pediatric brain tumors intraoperatively. Methods: Using a rapid acquisition RS device, we intraoperatively imaged fresh ex vivo brain tissue samples from 29 pediatric patients at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital between October 2018 and March 2020 in a prospective fashion. Small tissue samples measuring 2-4 mm per dimension were obtained with each individual tissue sample undergoing multiple unique Raman spectra acquisitions. All tissue samples from which Raman spectra were acquired underwent individual histopathology review. A labeled dataset of 678 unique Raman spectra gathered from 160 samples was then used to develop a machine learning model capable of (1) differentiating normal brain from tumor tissue and (2) normal brain from low-grade glioma (LGG) tissue. Results: Trained logistic regression model classifiers were developed using our labeled dataset. Model performance was evaluated using leave-one-patient-out cross-validation.

In this study we aimed to determine the oxygen delivery indexed to body surface area (Do<sub>2</sub>i) threshold associated with postoperative AKI in pediatric patients during CPB, and whether it remains clinically important in the context of other known independent risk factors. METHODS: A single-institution, retrospective study, encompassing 396 pediatric patients, who underwent heart surgery between April 2019 and April 2021 was undertaken. Time spent below Do<sub>2</sub>i thresholds were compared to determine the critical value for all stages of AKI occurring within 48 hours of surgery. Do<sub>2</sub>i threshold was then included in a classification analysis with known risk factors including nephrotoxic drug usage, surgical complexity, intraoperative data, comorbidities and ventricular function data, and vasoactive inotrope requirement to determine Do<sub>2</sub>i predictive importance. RESULTS: Logistic regression models showed cumulative time spent below a Do<sub>2</sub>i value of 350 mL/min/m<sup>2</sup> was associated with AKI. Random forest models, incorporating established risk factors, showed Do<sub>2</sub>i threshold still maintained predictive importance.

Multiple quality metrics, including length of stay (LOS), have been used in solid organ transplantation. However, limited data are available regarding trends and factors influencing LOS after pediatric HT. We hypothesized that various donor, peri-transplant and recipient factors affect LOS after pediatric HT. METHODS: We analyzed patients <18years at time of HT from January 2005 to December 2018 in the Pediatric Heart Transplant Society database, and examined LOS trends, defined prolonged LOS (PLOS=LOS>30days after HT), identified factors associated with PLOS and assessed outcomes. RESULTS: Of 4827 patients undergoing HT, 4414 patients were discharged and included for analysis. Overall median LOS was 19days[13,34]. Median LOS was longer in patients with congenital heart disease(CHD=25days[15,43] than with cardiomyopathy(CM=17days[12,27] across all ages. Median LOS in age <1year was 26-days[16,45.5] and in age >10year was 16days[11,26]. PLOS was seen in 1313 patients(30%). Patients with PLOS were younger, smaller and had longer CPB times. There was no difference in utilization of VAD at HT between groups, however, ECMO use at listing(8.45% vs 2.93%,p < 0.05) and HT was higher in the PLOS group(9.22% vs 1.58%,p < 0.05). PLOS was more common in patients with previous surgery, CHD, single ventricle physiology, recipient history of cardiac arrest or CPR, end organ dysfunction, lower GFR, use of mechanical ventilation at HT and Status 1A at HT.

39,"Fraiwan, 2022","BACKGROUND: Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) is a relatively common disorder in newborns, with a reported prevalence of 1-5 per 1000 births. It can lead to developmental abnormalities in terms of mechanical difficulties and a displacement of the joint (i.e., subluxation or dysplasia). An early diagnosis in the first few months from birth can drastically improve healing, render surgical intervention unnecessary and reduce bracing time. A pelvic X-ray inspection represents the gold standard for DDH diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning artificial intelligence have enabled the use of many image-based medical decision-making applications. The present study employs deep transfer learning in detecting DDH in pelvic X-ray images without the need for explicit measurements. METHODS: Pelvic anteroposterior X-ray images from 354 subjects (120 DDH and 234 normal) were collected locally at two hospitals in northern Jordan. A system that accepts these images as input and classifies them as DDH or normal was developed using thirteen deep transfer learning models. Various performance metrics were evaluated in addition to the overfitting/underfitting behavior and the training times. RESULTS: The highest mean DDH detection accuracy was 96.3% achieved using the DarkNet53 model, although other models achieved comparable results. A common theme across all the models was the extremely high sensitivity (i.e., recall) value at the expense of specificity. The F1 score, precision, recall and specificity for DarkNet53 were 95%, 90.6%, 100% and 94.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our automated method appears to be a highly accurate DDH screening and diagnosis method.

40,"Fang, 2022","Purpose Early confirmation or ruling out biliary atresia (BA) is essential for infants with delayed onset of jaundice. In the current practice, percutaneous liver biopsy and intraoperative cholangiography (IOC) remain the golden standards for diagnosis. In Taiwan, the diagnostic methods are invasive and can only be performed in selective medical centers. However, referrals from primary physicians and local pediatricians are often delayed because of lacking clinical suspicions. Ultrasounds (US) are common screening tools in local hospitals and clinics, but the pediatric hepatobiliary US particularly requires well-trained imaging personnel. The meaningful comprehension of US is highly dependent on individual experience. For screening BA through human observation on US images, the reported sensitivity and specificity were achieved by pediatric radiologists, pediatric hepatobiliary experts, or pediatric surgeons. Therefore, this research developed a tool based on deep learning models for screening BA to assist pediatric US image reading by general physicians and pediatricians. Methods De-identified hepatobiliary US images of 180 patients from Taichung Veterans General Hospital were retrospectively collected under the approval of the Institutional Review Board. Herein, the top network models of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Competition and other network models commonly used for US image recognition were included for further study to classify US images as BA or non-BA. The performance of different network models was expressed by the confusion matrix and receiver operating characteristic curve. There were two methods proposed to solve disagreement by US image classification of a single patient. The first and second methods were the positive-dominance law and threshold law. During the study, the US images of three successive patients suspected to have BA were classified by the trained models. Results Among all included patients contributing US images, 41 patients were diagnosed with BA by surgical intervention and 139 patients were either healthy controls or had non-BA diagnoses. In this study, a total of 1,976 original US images were enrolled. Among them, 417 and 1,559 raw images were from patients with BA and without BA, respectively. Meanwhile, ShuffleNet achieved the highest accuracy of 90.56% using the same training parameters as compared with other network models. The sensitivity and specificity were 67.83% and 96.76%, respectively. In addition, the undesired false-negative prediction was prevented by applying positive-dominance law to interpret different images of a single patient with an acceptable false-positive rate, which was 13.64%. For the three consecutive patients with delayed obstructive jaundice with IOC confirmed diagnoses, ShuffleNet achieved accurate diagnoses in two patients. Conclusion The current study provides a screening tool for identifying possible BA by hepatobiliary US images. The method was not designed to replace liver biopsy or IOC, but to decrease human error for interpretations of US. By applying the positive-dominance law to ShuffleNet, the false-negative rate and the specificities were 0 and 86.36%, respectively. The trained deep learning models could aid physicians other than pediatric surgeons, pediatric gastroenterologists, or pediatric radiologists, to prevent misreading pediatric hepatobiliary US images.

Right atrial (RA) mechanics as a proxy of right ventricular (RV) diastolic function in the early post-operative period after surgical repair for TOF has not been reported. We sought to evaluate RA and RV strain prior to hospital discharge after TOF repair and to identify important patient factors associated with strain using a machine learning method. Single center retrospective cohort study of TOF patients undergoing surgical repair, with analysis of RA and RV strain from pre-and post-operative echocardiograms. RA function was assessed by the peak RA strain, systolic RA strain rate, early diastolic RA strain rate and RA emptying fraction. RV systolic function was measured by global longitudinal strain. Pre- and post-operative values were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test. Gradient boosted machine (GBM) models were used to identify the most important predictors of post-operative strain. In total, 153 patients were enrolled, median age at TOF repair 3.5 months (25th-75th percentile: 2.2- 5.2), mostly male (67%), and White (64.1%). From pre-to post-operative period, there was significant worsening in all RA parameters and in RV strain. GBM models identified patient, anatomic, and surgical factors that were strong predictors of post-operative RA and RV strain. These factors included pulmonary valve and branch pulmonary artery Z scores, birth weight, gestational age and age at surgery, pre-operative RV fractional area change and oxygen saturation, type of outflow tract repair, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass, and early post-operative partial arterial pressure of oxygen. There is significant worsening in RA and RV strain early after TOF repair, indicating early alteration in diastolic and systolic function after surgery. Several patient and operative factors influence post-operative RV function. Most of the factors described are not readily modifiable, however they may inform pre-operative risk-stratification. The clinical application of RA strain and the prognostic implication of these early changes merit further study.

METHODS: We reviewed patients undergoing pyeloplasty from 2008 to 2020 at our institution, including all children and adolescents younger than 18 years. We developed a two-stage machine learning model from 34 clinical fields, which included patient characteristics, ultrasound findings, and anatomical variation. We fit and trained with a logistic lasso model for binary cure model and subsequent survival model. Feature importance on the model was determined with post-selection inference. Performance metrics included area under the receiver-operating-characteristic (AUROC), concordance, and leave-one-out cross validation. RESULTS: A total of 543 patients were identified, with a median preoperative and postoperative anteroposterior diameter of 23 and 10 mm, respectively. 39 of 232 patients included in the survival model required re-intervention. The cure and survival models performed well with a leave-one-out cross validation AUROC and concordance of 0.86 and 0.78, respectively.

Previous studies on occupancy prediction have focused primarily on adult healthcare settings, we sought to develop occupancy prediction models specifically tailored to the needs and characteristics of paediatric surgical settings. Materials and methods We conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort study at a surgical unit in a tertiary-care paediatric hospital in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. We developed a hierarchical modelling framework for predicting next-day census using multiple types of data - from bottom-up patient-specific orders and procedures to top-down temporal variables and departmental admission statistics. Result(s): The model predicted upcoming admissions and discharges with a median error of 17%-21% (2-3 patients per day), and next-day census with a median error of 7% (n=3). The primary factors driving these predictions included day of week and scheduled surgeries, as well as procedure duration, procedure type and days since admission. We found that paediatric surgical procedure duration was highly predictive of postoperative length of stay. Discussion Our hierarchical modelling framework provides an overview of the factors driving capacity issues in the paediatric surgical unit, highlighting the importance of both top-down temporal features (eg, day of week) as well as bottom-up electronic health records (EHR)derived features (eg, orders for patient) for predicting next-day census.

One strategy is to first rule out the most identifiable diagnosis. OBJECTIVE: To hypothesize a sequential machine-learning classifier could improve diagnostic performance by mimicking a clinician's strategy of excluding PA before distinguishing MB from EP. METHODS: We extracted 1800 total Image Biomarker Standardization Initiative (IBSI)-based features from T2- and gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted images in a multinational cohort of 274 MB, 156 PA, and 97 EP. We designed a 2-step sequential classifier - first ruling out PA, and next distinguishing MB from EP. For each step, we selected the best performing model from 6-candidate classifier using a reduced feature set, and measured performance on a holdout test set with the microaveraged F1 score. RESULTS: Optimal diagnostic performance was achieved using 2 decision steps, each with its own distinct imaging features and classifier method. A 3-way logistic regression classifier first distinguished PA from non-PA, with T2 uniformity and T1 contrast as the most relevant IBSI features (F1 score 0.8809).

MATERIALS & METHODS: In this multicenter, retrospective, longitudinal cohort study, ML algorithms were trained on n-grams extracted from free-text neurology notes, EEG and MRI reports, visit codes, medications, procedures, laboratories, and demographic information. Site-specific algorithms were developed at two epilepsy centers: one pediatric and one adult. Cases were defined as patients who underwent resective epilepsy surgery, and controls were patients with epilepsy with no history of surgery. The output of the ML algorithms was the estimated likelihood of candidacy for resective epilepsy surgery. Model performance was assessed using 10-fold cross-validation. RESULTS: There were 5880 children (n = 137 had surgery [2.3%]) and 7604 adults with epilepsy (n = 56 had surgery [0.7%]) included in the study. Pediatric surgical patients could be identified 2.0 years (range: 0-8.6 years) before beginning their presurgical evaluation with AUC =0.76 (95% CI: 0.70-0.82) and PR-AUC =0.13 (95% CI: 0.07-0.18). Adult surgical patients could be identified 1.0 year (range: 0-5.4 years) before beginning their presurgical evaluation with AUC =0.85 (95% CI: 0.78-0.93) and PR-AUC =0.31 (95% CI: 0.14-0.48). By the time patients began their presurgical evaluation, the ML algorithms identified pediatric and adult surgical patients with AUC =0.93 and 0.95, respectively. The mean squared error of the predicted probability of surgical candidacy (Brier scores) was 0.018 in pediatrics and 0.006 in adults.

CONTEXT: Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common endocrine malignancy.

METHODS: Random forests (augmented to select features based on our clinical measure of interest), in conjunction with interpretable rule sets, were used on demographic, ultrasound, and biopsy data of thyroid nodules from children younger than 18 years at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Accuracy, false-positive rate (FPR), false-negative rate (FNR), and area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) are reported. RESULTS: Our models predict nonbenign cytology and malignant histology better than historical outcomes. Specifically, we expect a 68.04% improvement in the FPR, 11.90% increase in accuracy, and 24.85% increase in AUROC for biopsy predictions in 67 patients (28 with benign and 39 with nonbenign histology).

55,"Pasha, 2021","STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective descriptive, multicenter study. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to predict the three-dimensional (3D) radiographic outcomes of the spinal surgery in a cohort of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) as a function preoperative spinal parameters and surgeon modifiable factors. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Current guidelines for posterior spinal fusion surgery (PSF) in AIS patients are based on two-dimensional classification of the spinal curves. Despite the high success rate, the prediction of the 3D spinal alignment at the follow-ups remains inconclusive. A data-driven surgical decision-making method that determines the combination of the surgical procedures and preoperative patient specific parameters that leads to a specific 3D global spinal alignment outcomes at the follow-ups can lessen the burden of surgical planning and improve patient satisfaction by setting expectations prior to surgery. METHODS: A dataset of 371 AIS patients who underwent a PSF with two-year follow-up were included. Demographics, 2D radiographic spinal and pelvic measurements, clinical measurements of the trunk shape, and the surgical procedures were collected prospectively. A previously developed classification of the preoperative global 3D spinal alignment was used as an additional predictor. The 3D spinal alignment (vertebral positions and rotations) at two-year follow-up was used as the predicted outcome. An ensemble learner was used to predict the 3D spinal alignment at two-year follow-up as a function of the preoperative parameters with and without considering the surgeon modifiable factors. RESULTS: The preoperative and surgical factors predicted three clusters of 3D surgical outcomes with an accuracy of 75%. The prediction accuracy decreased to 64% when only preoperative factors, without the surgical factors, were used in the model. Predictor importance analysis determined that preoperative distal junctional kyphosis, pelvic sagittal parameters, end-instrumented vertebra (EIV) angulation and translation, and the preoperative 3D clusters are the most important patient-specific predictors of the outcomes. Three surgical factors, upper and lower instrumented vertebrae, and the operating surgeon, were important surgical predictors. The role of surgeon in achieving a certain outcome clusters for specific ranges of preoperative T10-L2 kyphosis, EIV angulation and translation, thoracic and lumbar flexibilities, and patient's height was significant. CONCLUSION: Both preoperative patient-specific and surgeon modifiable parameters predicted the 3D global spinal alignment at two-year post PSF. Surgeon was determined as a predictor of the outcomes despite including 20 factors in the analysis that described the surgical moves. Methods to quantify the differences between the implemented surgeon modifiable factors are essential to improve outcome prediction in AIS spinal surgery.Level of Evidence: 3.",Ensemble learner,Random Forest,Surgical Outcome Prediction,Orthopedic Surgery,Posterior spinal fusion surgery,371,13.96733333,0.696096797,0.83,0.75,0.7165,0.7155,0.57794,0.6734,0.4918,0.7973,0.6727,Internal,Yes,High,Yes,USA,Multicenter,-0.208343321,1.177528394,0,Retrospective review,https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/BRS.0000000000003795,Paywall

Material(s) and Method(s): Predictive models were developed and validated on a dataset acquired from 430 children and adolescents aged 0-18 years, based on a range of information encompassing history, clinical examination, laboratory parameters, and abdominal ultrasonography. Logistic regression, random forests, and gradient boosting machines were used for predicting the three target variables. Result(s): A random forest classifier achieved areas under the precision-recall curve of 0.94, 0.92, and 0.70, respectively, for the diagnosis, management, and severity of appendicitis. We identified smaller subsets of 6, 17, and 18 predictors for each of targets that sufficed to achieve the same performance as the model based on the full set of 38 variables. We used these findings to develop the user-friendly online Appendicitis Prediction Tool for children with suspected appendicitis. Discussion(s): This pilot study considered the most extensive set of predictor and target variables to date and is the first to simultaneously predict all three targets in children: diagnosis, management, and severity. Moreover, this study presents the first ML model for appendicitis that was deployed as an open access easy-to-use online tool. Conclusion(s): ML algorithms help to overcome the diagnostic and management challenges posed by appendicitis in children and pave the way toward a more personalized approach to medical decision-making.

Previous studies evaluated outcomes in peritoneal drain placement versus laparotomy, but the accuracy of the presumptive diagnosis remains unknown without bowel visualization. Predictive analytics provide the opportunity to determine the etiology of perforation and guide surgical decision making. The purpose of this investigation was to build and evaluate machine learning models to differentiate NEC and SIP.

Patient characteristics were analyzed using machine learning methodologies, which were optimized through areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The model was further evaluated using a validation cohort. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified. A random forest model achieved 98% AUROC while a ridge logistic regression model reached 92% AUROC in differentiating diseases.

This study included 56 Korean patients with UCLP, who were treated by a single surgeon and a single orthodontist with the same treatment protocol. Lateral cephalograms were obtained before the commencement of orthodontic/orthopedic treatment (T0; mean age, 6.3 years) and at at least of 15 years of age (T1; mean age, 16.7 years). 38 cephalometric variables were measured. At T1 stage, 3 cephalometric criteria (ANB <= -3degree; Wits appraisal <= -5 mm; Harvold unit difference >=34 mm for surgery group) were used to classify the subjects into the surgery group (n = 10, 17.9%) and non-surgery group (n = 46, 82.1%). Independent t-test was used for statistical analyses. The Boruta method and XGBoost algorithm were used to determine the cephalometric variables for the prediction model. At T0 stage, 2 variables exhibited a significant intergroup difference (ANB and facial convexity angle [FCA], all P < 0.05). However, 18 cephalometric variables at the T1 stage and 14 variables in the amount of change (DELTAT1-T0) exhibited significant intergroup differences (all, more significant than P < 0.05). At T0 stage, the ANB, PP-FH, combination factor, and FCA were selected as predictive parameters with a cross-validation accuracy of 87.4%.

60,"Jalali, 2021","BACKGROUND: Craniosynostosis is the premature fusion of >=1 cranial sutures and often requires surgical intervention. Surgery may involve extensive osteotomies, which can lead to substantial blood loss. Currently, there are no consensus recommendations for guiding blood conservation or transfusion in this patient population. The aim of this study is to develop a machine-learning model to predict blood product transfusion requirements for individual pediatric patients undergoing craniofacial surgery. METHODS: Using data from 2143 patients in the Pediatric Craniofacial Surgery Perioperative Registry, we assessed 6 machine-learning classification and regression models based on random forest, adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), neural network, gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine, and elastic net methods with inputs from 22 demographic and preoperative features. We developed classification models to predict an individual's overall need for transfusion and regression models to predict the number of blood product units to be ordered preoperatively. The study is reported according to the Transparent Reporting of a multivariable prediction model for Individual Prognosis Or Diagnosis (TRIPOD) checklist for prediction model development. RESULTS: The GBM performed best in both domains, with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.87 +/- 0.03 (95% confidence interval) and F-score of 0.91 +/- 0.04 for classification, and a mean squared error of 1.15 +/- 0.12, R-squared (R) of 0.73 +/- 0.02, and root mean squared error of 1.05 +/- 0.06 for regression. GBM feature ranking determined that the following variables held the most information for prediction: platelet count, weight, preoperative hematocrit, surgical volume per institution, age, and preoperative hemoglobin. We then produced a calculator to show the number of units of blood that should be ordered preoperatively for an individual patient.

METHODS: A total of 1481 neonatal surgeries performed between May 2016 and December 2019 at a children's hospital were included in this study. Perioperative variables, including vital signs during surgery, were collected and used to predict postoperative mortality. Several widely used machine learning methods were trained and evaluated on split datasets. The model with the best performance was explained by SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) at different levels. RESULTS: The random forest model achieved the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 in the validation set. TreeExplainer of SHAP was used to identify the risk factors for neonatal postoperative mortality. The explainable machine learning model not only explains the risk factors identified by traditional statistical analysis but also identifies additional risk factors. The visualization of feature contributions at different levels by SHAP makes the ""black-box"" machine learning model easily understood by clinicians and families.

62,"Hayashi, 2021","Background: Diagnosing pediatric appendicitis by ultrasonography (US) is difficult because US requires significant training and skill. We evaluated whether artificial intelligence (AI) can augment US. Materials and Methods: Among 70 abdominal ultrasound videos containing 85-347 images each, 50 were used to train the AI neural network. Each video was categorized based on the detection percentage and percent accuracy: most (>50%), partial (10-50%), and none (<10%). Test 1 involved verification of appendix detection by AI using the remaining 20 videos. Test 2 involved the evaluation of the effect of AI utilization on pediatricians. Results: From 50 videos, 6914 images were used to train the AI network. In test 1, 3 pediatric surgeons judged 10 (50.0%), 4 (20.0%), and 6 (30.0%) videos as ""most,"" ""partial,"" and ""none,"" respectively, regarding the detection percentage; 7 (35.0%), 7 (35.0%), and 6 (30.0%) videos were judged, respectively, concerning the percent accuracy. Five (83.3%) of six test videos with a scan area depth of 8 cm were judged as ""none"" for both detection and accuracy. In test 2, six videos were also judged as ""none"" for both categories, showing a negative effect on the participants (5 pediatric residents and 5 pediatric intensive-emergency fellows), but the other categories showed little negative effect.

63,"Hale, 2021","PURPOSE: While conventional statistical approaches have been used to identify risk factors for cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt failure, these methods may not fully capture the complex contribution of clinical, radiologic, surgical, and shunt-specific variables influencing this outcome. Using prospectively collected data from the Hydrocephalus Clinical Research Network (HCRN) patient registry, we applied machine learning (ML) approaches to create a predictive model of CSF shunt failure. METHODS: Pediatric patients (age < 19 years) undergoing first-time CSF shunt placement at six HCRN centers were included. CSF shunt failure was defined as a composite outcome including requirement for shunt revision, endoscopic third ventriculostomy, or shunt infection within 5 years of initial surgery. Performance of conventional statistical and 4 ML models were compared. RESULTS: Our cohort consisted of 1036 children undergoing CSF shunt placement, of whom 344 (33.2%) experienced shunt failure. Thirty-eight clinical, radiologic, surgical, and shunt-design variables were included in the ML analyses. Of all ML algorithms tested, the artificial neural network (ANN) had the strongest performance with an area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.71. The ANN had a specificity of 90% and a sensitivity of 68%, meaning that the ANN can effectively rule-in patients most likely to experience CSF shunt failure (i.e., high specificity) and moderately effective as a tool to rule-out patients at high risk of CSF shunt failure (i.e., moderately sensitive). The ANN was independently validated in 155 patients (prospectively collected, retrospectively analyzed).

In this study, the machine learning (ML) was used to predict postoperative blood coagulation function of children with CHD, and assess an array of ML models. METHODS: This was a retrospective and data mining study. Based on the samples of 1,690 children with CHD, and screening data based on demographic characteristics, conventional coagulation tests (CCTs) and complete blood count (CBC), with a precise data selection process, and the support of data mining and ML algorithms including Decision tree, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Adaptive Boost (AdaBoost) and Random Forest model, and explored the best prediction models of postoperative blood coagulation function for children with CHD by models performance measured in the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), calibration or Lift curves, and further verified the reliability of the models with statistical tests. RESULTS: In primary objective prediction, as decision tree, Naive Bayes, SVM, the AUC of our prediction algorithm was 0.81, 0.82, 0.82, respectively. The accuracy rate of the overall forecast has reached more than 75%. Subsequently, we furtherly build improved models. Among them, the true positive rate of the AdaBoost, Random Forest and SVM prediction models reached more than 80% in the ROC curve. These overall accuracy rate indicated a good classification model. Combined calibration curves and Lift curves, the better fit is the SVM model, which predicted postoperative abnormal coagulation, Lift =2.2, postoperative normal coagulation, Lift =1.8. The statistical results furtherly proved the reliability of ML models. The age, sex, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), white blood cell count (WBC) and platelet count (PLT) were the key features for predicting the postoperative blood coagulation state of children with CHD.

Survival biomarkers are challenging to identify due to the relatively low numbers of individual tumor types. 69 children with biopsy-confirmed brain tumors were recruited into this study. All participants had perfusion and diffusion weighted imaging performed at diagnosis. Imaging data were processed using conventional methods, and a Bayesian survival analysis performed. Unsupervised and supervised machine learning were performed with the survival features, to determine novel sub-groups related to survival. Sub-group analysis was undertaken to understand differences in imaging features. Survival analysis showed that a combination of diffusion and perfusion imaging were able to determine two novel sub-groups of brain tumors with different survival characteristics (p < 0.01), which were subsequently classified with high accuracy (98%) by a neural network. Analysis of high-grade tumors showed a marked difference in survival (p = 0.029) between the two clusters with high risk and low risk imaging features.

Hypospadias anatomical variables such as meatal location, quality of urethral plate, glans size, and ventral curvature have been identified as predictors for postoperative outcomes but there is still significant subjectivity between evaluators. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A hypospadias image database with 1169 anonymized images (837 distal and 332 proximal) was used. Images were standardized (ventral aspect of the penis including the glans, shaft, and scrotum) and classified into distal or proximal and uploaded for training with TensorFlow. Data from the training were outputted to TensorBoard, to assess for the loss function. The model was then run on a set of 29 ""Test"" images randomly selected. Same set of images were distributed among expert clinicians in pediatric urology. Inter- and intrarater analyses were performed using Fleiss Kappa statistical analysis using the same 29 images shown to the algorithm. RESULTS: After training with 627 images, detection accuracy was 60%. With1169 images, accuracy increased to 90%. Inter-rater analysis among expert pediatric urologists was k= 0.86 and intrarater 0.74. Image recognition model emulates the almost perfect inter-rater agreement between experts. CONCLUSION: Our model emulates expert human classification of patients with distal/proximal hypospadias.

Current approaches to prognostication rely upon conventional statistical methods such as Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models and have suboptimal predictive ability. Given the success of deep learning approaches in other specialties, we sought to develop and compare deep learning models with CPH models for the prediction of 5-year survival in pediatric GU-RMS patients. METHODS: Patients less than 20 years of age with GU-RMS were identified within the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (1998-2011). Deep neural networks (DNN) were trained and tested on an 80/20 split of the dataset in a 5-fold cross-validated fashion. Multivariable CPH models were developed in parallel. The primary outcomes were 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS). Variables used for prediction were age, sex, race, primary site, histology, degree of tumor extension, tumor size, receipt of surgery, and receipt of radiation. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted, and DNN models were tested for calibration. RESULTS: 277 patients were included. The area under the curve (AUC) for the DNN models was 0.93 for OS and 0.91 for DSS. AUC for the CPH models was 0.82 for OS and 0.84 for DSS.

72,"Avila, 2021: Healthy","Computer-aided diagnosis is a research area of increasing interest in third-level pediatric hospital care. The effectiveness of surgical treatments improves with accurate and timely information, and machine learning techniques have been employed to assist practitioners in making decisions. In this context, the prediction of the discharge diagnosis of new incoming patients could make a difference for successful treatments and optimal resource use. In this paper, a computer-aided diagnosis system is proposed to provide statistical information on the discharge diagnosis of a new incoming patient, based on the historical records from previously treated patients. The proposed system was trained and tested using a dataset of 1196 records; the dataset was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases, version 10 (ICD10). Among the processing steps, relevant features for classification were selected using the sequential forward selection wrapper, and outliers were removed using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise. Ensembles of decision trees were trained with different strategies, and the highest classification accuracy was obtained with the extreme Gradient boosting algorithm. A 10-fold cross-validation strategy was employed for system evaluation, and performance comparison was performed in terms of accuracy and F-measure.

73,"Attallah, 2021","Childhood medulloblastoma (MB) is a threatening malignant tumor affecting children all over the globe. It is believed to be the foremost common pediatric brain tumor causing death. Early and accurate classification of childhood MB and its classes are of great importance to help doctors choose the suitable treatment and observation plan, avoid tumor progression, and lower death rates. The current gold standard for diagnosing MB is the histopathology of biopsy samples. However, manual analysis of such images is complicated, costly, time-consuming, and highly dependent on the expertise and skills of pathologists, which might cause inaccurate results. This study aims to introduce a reliable computer-assisted pipeline called CoMB-Deep to automatically classify MB and its classes with high accuracy from histopathological images. This key challenge of the study is the lack of childhood MB datasets, especially its four categories (defined by the WHO) and the inadequate related studies. All relevant works were based on either deep learning (DL) or textural analysis feature extractions. Also, such studies employed distinct features to accomplish the classification procedure. Besides, most of them only extracted spatial features. Nevertheless, CoMB-Deep blends the advantages of textural analysis feature extraction techniques and DL approaches. The CoMB-Deep consists of a composite of DL techniques. Initially, it extracts deep spatial features from 10 convolutional neural networks (CNNs). It then performs a feature fusion step using discrete wavelet transform (DWT), a texture analysis method capable of reducing the dimension of fused features. Next, the CoMB-Deep explores the best combination of fused features, enhancing the performance of the classification process using two search strategies. Afterward, it employs two feature selection techniques on the fused feature sets selected in the previous step. A bi-directional long-short term memory (Bi-LSTM) network; a DL-based approach that is utilized for the classification phase. CoMB-Deep maintains two classification categories: binary category for distinguishing between the abnormal and normal cases and multi-class category to identify the subclasses of MB. The results of the CoMB-Deep for both classification categories prove that it is reliable. The results also indicate that the feature sets selected using both search strategies have enhanced the performance of Bi-LSTM compared to individual spatial deep features. CoMB-Deep is compared to related studies to verify its competitiveness, and this comparison confirmed its robustness and outperformance. Hence, CoMB-Deep can help pathologists perform accurate diagnoses, reduce misdiagnosis risks that could occur with manual diagnosis, accelerate the classification procedure, and decrease diagnosis costs. © Copyright © 2021 Attallah.",Neural network,NN,Diagnosis,Neurosurgery,Medulloblastoma (H&E),204,7.82,0.239690619,,0.93445,0.8959,0.95889,0.91235,0.89865,0.94299,0.96745,0.90976,Cross-validation,No,Low,Yes,India,Hospital,-0.213397035,0.243309116,Radiology,Retrospective review,https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2021.663592,

METHODS: Patients admitted to hospital with symptoms of abdominal pain whose pediatric appendicitis scores greater than 3 were included in the study. Clinical, radiologic, and laboratory findings and as a new biomarker calprotectin (CPT) concentrations were evaluated individually and combined using artificial neural networks (ANNs), which revealed latent relationships for a definitive diagnosis. RESULTS: Three hundred twenty patients were evaluated (190 appendicitis [43 perforated] vs 130 no appendicitis). The mean +/- SD age was 11.3 +/- 3.6 years and 63% were male. Pediatric appendicitis scores, white blood cell (WBC) count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), C-reactive protein (CRP) level, procalcitonin (PCT) and CPT concentrations were higher in the appendicitis group; however, only WBC and ANC were higher in first 24 hours of pain. White blood cells and CRP were diagnostic markers in patients whose appendix could not be visualized using ultrasonography (US). On classic receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the areas under the curve (AUCs) were not strong enough for differential diagnosis (WBC, 0.73; ANC, 0.72; CRP, 0.65; PCT and CPT, 0.61). However, when the physical examination, US, and laboratory findings were analyzed in a multivariate model and the ROC analysis obtained from the variables with ANN, an ROC curve could be obtained with 0.91 AUC, 89.8% sensitivity, and 81.2% specificity. C-reactive protein and PCT were diagnostic for perforated appendicitis with 0.83 and 0.75 AUC on ROC.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 44 AIS patients (female/male: 34/10; PJK/non-PJK: 34/10) who met the inclusion criteria between January 2013 and December 2018 were retrospectively recruited from West China Hospital. Thirty-seven clinical and radiological features were acquired by two independent investigators. Univariate analyses between PJK and non-PJK groups were carried out. Twelve models were built by using four types of machine learning algorithms in conjunction with two oversampling methods [the synthetic minority technique (SMOTE) and random oversampling]. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used for model discrimination, and the clinical utility was evaluated by using F1 score and accuracy. The risk factors were simultaneously analyzed by a Cox regression and machine learning. RESULTS: Statistical differences between PJK and non-PJK groups were as follows: gender (p = 0.001), preoperative factors [thoracic kyphosis (p = 0.03), T1 slope angle (T1S, p = 0.078)], and postoperative factors [T1S (p = 0.097), proximal junctional angle (p = 0.003), upper instrumented vertebra (UIV) - UIV + 1 (p = 0.001)]. Random forest using SMOTE achieved the best prediction performance with AUC = 0.944, accuracy = 0.909, and F1 score = 0.667 on independent testing dataset. Cox model revealed that male gender and larger preoperative T1S were independent prognostic factors of PJK (odds ratio = 10.701 and 57.074, respectively).

82,"Grimm, 2020","Background: For the segmentation of medical imaging data, a multitude of precise but very specific algorithms exist. In previous studies, we investigated the possibility of segmenting MRI data to determine cerebrospinal fluid and brain volume using a classical machine learning algorithm. It demonstrated good clinical usability and a very accurate correlation of the volumes to the single area determination in a reproducible axial layer. This study aims to investigate whether these established segmentation algorithms can be transferred to new, more generalizable deep learning algorithms employing an extended transfer learning procedure and whether medically meaningful segmentation is possible. Methods: Ninety‐five routinely performed true FISP MRI sequences were retrospectively analyzed in 43 patients with pediatric hydrocephalus. Using a freely available and clinically established segmentation algorithm based on a hidden Markov random field model, four classes of segmentation (brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), background, and tissue) were generated. Fifty‐nine randomly selected data sets (10,432 slices) were used as a training data set. Images were augmented for contrast, brightness, and random left/right and X/Y translation. A convolutional neural network (CNN) for semantic image segmentation composed of an encoder and corresponding decoder subnetwork was set up.

83,"Chang, 2020","BACKGROUND: Congenital heart disease accounts for almost a third of all major congenital anomalies. Congenital heart defects have a significant impact on morbidity, mortality and health costs for children and adults. Research regarding the risk of pre-surgical mortality is scarce. OBJECTIVES: Our goal is to generate a predictive model calculator adapted to the regional reality focused on individual mortality prediction among patients with congenital heart disease undergoing cardiac surgery. METHODS: Two thousand two hundred forty CHD consecutive patients' data from InCor's heart surgery program was used to develop and validate the preoperative risk-of-death prediction model of congenital patients undergoing heart surgery. There were six artificial intelligence models most cited in medical references used in this study: Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Random Forest (RF), Extra Trees (ET), Stochastic Gradient Boosting (SGB), Ada Boost Classification (ABC) and Bag Decision Trees (BDT). RESULTS: The top performing areas under the curve were achieved using Random Forest (0.902). Most influential predictors included previous admission to ICU, diagnostic group, patient's height, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, body mass, arterial oxygen saturation, and pulmonary atresia. These combined predictor variables represent 67.8% of importance for the risk of mortality in the Random Forest algorithm. CONCLUSIONS: The representativeness of ""hospital death"" is greater in patients up to 66 cm in height and body mass index below 13.0 for InCor's patients. The proportion of ""hospital death"" declines with the increased arterial oxygen saturation index.

Previous studies using interfrontal angles have evaluated differences in specific skull landmarks; however, these measurements are difficult to readily ascertain in clinical practice and fail to assess the complete skull contour. This pilot project employs machine learning algorithms to combine statistical shape information with expert ratings to generate a novel objective method of measuring the severity of metopic CS.Expert ratings of normal and metopic skull CT images were collected. Skull-shape analysis was conducted using ShapeWorks software. Machine-learning was used to combine the expert ratings with our shape analysis model to predict the severity of metopic CS using CT images. Our model was then compared to the gold standard using interfrontal angles.Seventeen metopic skull CT images of patients 5 to 15 months old were assigned a severity by 18 craniofacial surgeons, and 65 nonaffected controls were included with a 0 severity. Our model accurately correlated the level of skull deformity with severity (P < 0.10) and predicted the severity of metopic CS more often than models using interfrontal angles (chi = 5.46, P = 0.019). This is the first study that combines shape information with expert ratings to generate an objective measure of severity for metopic CS.

For medical purposes, simple conceptual decision-making models that can learn are widely used. Decision trees are reliable and effective techniques which provide high classification accuracy. We tested if we could detect appendicitis and differentiate uncomplicated from complicated cases using machine learning algorithms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed all cases admitted between 2010 and 2016 that fell into the following categories: healthy controls (Group 1); sham controls (Group 2); sham disease (Group 3), and acute abdomen (Group 4). The latter group was further divided into four groups: false laparotomy; uncomplicated appendicitis; complicated appendicitis without abscess, and complicated appendicitis with abscess. Patients with comorbidities and whose complete blood count and/or pathology results were lacking were excluded. Data were collected for demographics, preoperative blood analysis, and postoperative diagnosis. Various machine learning algorithms were applied to detect appendicitis patients. RESULTS: There were 7244 patients with a mean age of 6.84 +/- 5.31 years, of whom 82.3% (5960/7244) were male. Most algorithms tested, especially linear methods, provided similar performance measures. We preferred the decision tree model due to its easier interpretability. With this algorithm, we detected appendicitis patients with 93.97% area under the curve (AUC), 94.69% accuracy, 93.55% sensitivity, and 96.55% specificity, and uncomplicated appendicitis with 79.47% AUC, 70.83% accuracy, 66.81% sensitivity, and 81.88% specificity.

Our objectives in this study were: 1) To develop predictive models of last-minute surgery cancellation, utilizing machine learning technologies, from patient-specific and contextual data from two distinct pediatric surgical sites of a single institution; and 2) to identify specific key predictors that impact children's risk of day-of-surgery cancellation. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We extracted five-year datasets (2012-2017) from the Electronic Health Record at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. By leveraging patient-specific information and contextual data, machine learning classifiers were developed to predict all patient-related cancellations and the most frequent four cancellation causes individually (patient illness, ""no show,"" NPO violation and refusal to undergo surgery by either patient or family). Model performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) using ten-fold cross-validation. The best performance for predicting all-cause surgery cancellation was generated by gradient-boosted logistic regression models, with AUC 0.781 (95% CI: [0.764,0.797]) and 0.740 (95% CI: [0.726,0.771]) for the two campuses. Of the four most frequent individual causes of cancellation, ""no show"" and NPO violation were predicted better than patient illness or patient/family refusal. Models showed good cross-campus generalizability (AUC: 0.725/0.735, when training on one site and testing on the other). To synthesize a human-oriented conceptualization of pediatric surgery cancellation, an iterative step-forward approach was applied to identify key predictors which may inform the design of future preventive interventions.

Nowadays, during therapy radiologists have to spend a vast amount of time assessing the volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by manual segmentation on Computed Tomography (CT) images. Further, some of the segmentations are prone to radiologist bias and high intraobserver variability. To improve this, researchers are exploring methods to automate the process, which would enable faster and more unbiased results. In this study, we propose the application of U-Net convolutional neural network in order to automatically segment CT brain scans for location of CSF. U-Net is a neural network that has proven to be successful for various interdisciplinary segmentation tasks. We optimised training using state of the art methods, including ""1cycle"" learning rate policy, transfer learning, generalized dice loss function, mixed float precision, self-attention, and data augmentation. Even though the study was performed using a limited amount of data (80 CT images), our experiment has shown near human-level performance. We managed to achieve a 0.917 mean dice score with 0.0352 standard deviation on cross validation across the training data and a 0.9506 mean dice score on a separate test set.

Early identification of patients at risk of surgical site infections is a major clinical goal. Our objective for this study was to determine whether deep learning AI techniques could identify patients at risk of intra-abdominal abscess de-velopment post-appendectomy using clinical data for pediatric patients undergoing appendectomy. Methods. A dataset of 1,574 patients classified by surgeons as negative (1,328) or positive (246) for Intra-Abdominal Abscess Post-Appendectomy for Appendicitis were selected from a database containing 6,127 patients less than 19 years-old who had appendectomy at our institution between 2009-2018. Demographic, clinical, and surgical information were extracted. 34 Independent variables were identified to be useful for the study. Using Random Forest methodology 12 variables with the highest influ-ence on the outcome were selected for the final dataset. Data imputation (MICE algo-rithm) was used to replace missing data points. Two ""Reproducible"" Artificial Neural Networks with different architectures were developed to predict the risk of developing Intra-Abdominal Abscess Post- Appendectomy: Model (1) 12 Inputs, 3 hidden layers with 12 Neurons each, and 1 Output. Model (2) 12 Inputs, 2 hidden layers with 18 Results. For the 1,574 patients (80%-20% used as training and test sets), Model (1) achieved Accuracy of 89.84%, Sensitivity of ~ 70%, and Specificity of 93.61% on the test set while Model (2) achieved Accuracy of 84.13%, Sensitivity of 81.63%, and Specificity of 84.6%. The difference between the models is that in Model (2) we over sampled the minority class (using SMOTE algorithm) to balance both classes which helped the model to learn both classes without bias and improved sensitivity over Model (1). Conclusion. Deep learning algorithms applied to enough clinical variables can identify patients with high probability for the risk of developing intra-abdomi -nal abscess post-appendectomy. While further test sets are necessary to validate the models, Artificial Neural Networks can be an important addition to current post-surgical care guidelines to personalize and optimize care to reduce infections following appendectomy.

This study used a machine learning pipeline to comprehensively investigate the predictive value of the baseline variables derived from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and provide models for identifying patients at risk for deterioration. Methods and results: Longitudinal deterioration for 153 patients with rTOF was categorized as 'none', 'minor', or 'major' based on changes in ventricular size and ejection fraction between two CMR scans at least 6 months apart (median 2.7 years). Baseline variables were measured at the time of the first CMR. An exhaustive variable search with a support vector machine classifier and five-fold cross-validation was used to predict deterioration and identify the most useful variables. For predicting any deterioration (minor or major) vs. no deterioration, the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 0.82 +/- 0.06. For predicting major deterioration vs. minor or no deterioration, the AUC was 0.77 +/- 0.07. Baseline left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV circumferential strain, and pulmonary regurgitation were most useful for achieving accurate predictions.

This study used a machine learning pipeline to comprehensively investigate the predictive value of the baseline variables derived from cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and provide models for identifying patients at risk for deterioration. Methods and results: Longitudinal deterioration for 153 patients with rTOF was categorized as 'none', 'minor', or 'major' based on changes in ventricular size and ejection fraction between two CMR scans at least 6 months apart (median 2.7 years). Baseline variables were measured at the time of the first CMR. An exhaustive variable search with a support vector machine classifier and five-fold cross-validation was used to predict deterioration and identify the most useful variables. For predicting any deterioration (minor or major) vs. no deterioration, the mean area under the curve (AUC) was 0.82 +/- 0.06. For predicting major deterioration vs. minor or no deterioration, the AUC was 0.77 +/- 0.07. Baseline left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV circumferential strain, and pulmonary regurgitation were most useful for achieving accurate predictions.

95,"Irles, 2018",Intestinal perforation (IP) associated with necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is one of the leading causes of mortality in premature neonates; with major nutritional and neurodevelopmental sequelae. Since predicting which neonates will develop perforation is still challenging; clinicians might benefit considerably with an early diagnosis tool and the identification of critical factors. The aim of this study was to forecast IP related to NEC and to investigate the predictive quality of variables; based on a machine learning-based technique. The Back-propagation neural network was used to train and test the models with a dataset constructed from medical records of the NICU; with birth and hospitalization maternal and neonatal clinical; feeding and laboratory parameters; as input variables. The outcome of the models was diagnosis: (1) IP associated with NEC; (2) NEC or (3) control (neither IP nor NEC). Models accurately estimated IP with good performances; the regression coefficients between the experimental and predicted data were R2 > 0.97. Critical variables for IP prediction were identified: neonatal platelets and neutrophils; orotracheal intubation; birth weight; sex; arterial blood gas parameters (pCO2 and HCO3); gestational age; use of fortifier; patent ductus arteriosus; maternal age and maternal morbidity.

We aimed to apply superlearning, an ensemble machine learning method, to the prediction of 30-day neonatal postoperative mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We included neonates in the 2012-2014 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric. Patients treated in 2012-13 were used in model development (n = 6499), and patients treated in 2014 formed the validation sample (n = 3552). Our superlearner algorithm included 14 regression and machine learning algorithms and included all preoperative patient demographic and clinical characteristics, including indicator variables for surgical procedures. Performance was evaluated using mean squared error and measures of discrimination and calibration. RESULTS: The superlearner out-performed all individual algorithms with regard to cross-validated mean squared error. It showed excellent discrimination, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.91 in development and 0.87 in validation. The superlearner showed good calibration in development but not in validation (Cox calibration test P = 0.06 and P < 0.001, respectively). Performance was improved when the superlearner was fit using only variables strongly associated with mortality in bivariate analysis (area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve 0.89, calibration test P = 0.63 in validation). CONCLUSIONS: Superlearning provided improved or equivalent performance compared with individual regression and machine learning algorithms for predicting neonatal surgical mortality.

97,"Cherukuri, 2018","OBJECTIVE: Hydrocephalus is a medical condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain. Segmentation of brain imagery into brain tissue and CSF [before and after surgery, i.e., preoperative (pre-op) versus postoperative (post-op)] plays a crucial role in evaluating surgical treatment. Segmentation of pre-op images is often a relatively straightforward problem and has been well researched. However, segmenting post-op computational tomographic (CT) scans becomes more challenging due to distorted anatomy and subdural hematoma collections pressing on the brain. Most intensity- and feature-based segmentation methods fail to separate subdurals from brain and CSF as subdural geometry varies greatly across different patients and their intensity varies with time. We combat this problem by a learning approach that treats segmentation as supervised classification at the pixel level, i.e., a training set of CT scans with labeled pixel identities is employed. METHODS: Our contributions include: 1) a dictionary learning framework that learns class (segment) specific dictionaries that can efficiently represent test samples from the same class while poorly represent corresponding samples from other classes; 2) quantification of associated computation and memory footprint; and 3) a customized training and test procedure for segmenting post-op hydrocephalic CT images. RESULTS: Experiments performed on infant CT brain images acquired from the CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda reveal the success of our method against the state-of-the-art alternatives. We also demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is computationally less burdensome and exhibits a graceful degradation against a number of training samples, enhancing its deployment potential.",Neural network,NN,Decision Support,Neurosurgery,CSF segmentation,32,21.788,0.521523554,,0.8871,0.79834,0.6582,0.5611,0.8056,0.4918,0.94769,0.6742,Cross-validation,No,Low,Yes,Uganda,Hospital,-0.218602057,2.366046597,0,Retrospective review,https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2017.2783305,Paywall

Researchers have proposed that characterizing presurgical network connectivity may improve the surgical management of intractable seizures, but few studies have rigorously examined the relationship between network activity and surgical outcome. In this study, we assessed whether local and global measures of network activity differentiated patients with favorable (seizure-free) versus unfavorable (seizure-persistent) surgical outcomes. METHODS: Seventeen pediatric intracranial electroencephalography (IEEG) patients were retrospectively examined. For each patient, 1,200 random interictal epochs of 1-s duration were analyzed. Functional connectivity networks were constructed using an amplitude-based correlation technique (Spearman correlation). Global network synchrony was computed as the average pairwise connectivity strength. Local signal heterogeneity was defined for each channel as the variability of EEG amplitude (root mean square) and absolute delta power (muV<sup>2</sup> /Hz) across epochs. A support vector machine learning algorithm used global and local measures to classify patients by surgical outcome. Classification was assessed using the Leave-One-Out (LOO) permutation test. RESULTS: Global synchrony was increased in the seizure-persistent group compared to seizure-free patients (Student's t-test, p = 0.006). Seizure-onset zone (SOZ) electrodes exhibited increased signal heterogeneity compared to non-SOZ electrodes, primarily in seizure-persistent patients. Global synchrony and local heterogeneity measures were used to accurately classify 16 (94.1%) of 17 patients by surgical outcome (LOO test, iterations = 10,000, p < 0.001).

In this sense, classification of those surgical risks provides enormous benefits as the a priori estimation of surgical outcomes depending on either the type of disease or the type of repair, and other elements that influence the final result. This preventive estimation may help to avoid future complications, or even death. METHODS: We have evaluated four machine learning algorithms to achieve our objective: multilayer perceptron, self-organizing map, radial basis function networks and decision trees. The architectures implemented have the aim of classifying among three types of surgical risk: low complexity, medium complexity and high complexity. RESULTS: Accuracy outcomes achieved range between 80% and 99%, being the multilayer perceptron method the one that offered a higher hit ratio.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among more than 800 ventriculoperitoneal shunt procedures which had been performed between April 2000 and April 2011, 68 patients with shunt infection and 80 controls that fulfilled a set of meticulous inclusion/exclusion criteria were consecutively enrolled. Univariate analysis was performed for a long list of risk factors, and those with p value < 0.2 were used to create ANN and logistic regression (LR) models. RESULTS: Five variables including birth weight, age at the first shunting, shunt revision, prematurity, and myelomeningocele were significantly associated with shunt infection via univariate analysis, and two other variables (intraventricular hemorrhage and coincided infections) had a p value of less than 0.2. Using these seven input variables, ANN and LR models predicted shunt infection with an accuracy of 83.1 % (AUC; 91.98 %, 95 % CI) and 55.7 % (AUC; 76.5, 95 % CI), respectively. The contribution of the factors in the predictive performance of ANN in descending order was history of shunt revision, low birth weight (under 2000 g), history of prematurity, the age at the first shunt procedure, history of intraventricular hemorrhage, history of myelomeningocele, and coinfection.

103,"Moein, 2015","Systemic-to-Pulmonary Artery (SPA) shunt surgery, one of the most common cardiac surgical procedures in the newborn period, provides a means to palliate children with limited pulmonary blood flow, such as in Tetralogy of Fallot. Despite the simplicity of the procedure, it is associated with significant morbidity (such as need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), and long post-operative length of stay (PLOS) in the hospital following surgery) and mortality. These outcomes are known to be impacted by a number of complex factors (including patient specific and procedure specific factors, perioperative related factors, etc.), whose relative importance in clinical decision making remains the domain of clinical judgment. The increasing availability of multi-modal data on patient care and outcomes opens up the opportunity to assess clinical practices from a more data-driven perspective. In this paper, we report results from a study of 1036 patients (from 44 children's hospitals across the US) during 2009-2014 that applies a machine learning approach to predicting post-operative outcomes for patients in the Pediatric Health Information System (PHIS) database. We demonstrate that it is feasible to achieve significant prediction benefits using a standard machine learning approach (random forests) on a carefully constructed dataset, showing the value of applying machine learning even with noisy administrative databases. The methods we describe can be used to identify potential important variables that lead to good clinical judgment as defined by desirable clinical outcomes.",Ensemble learner,Random Forest,Surgical Outcome Prediction,Cardiac Surgery,Systemic-pulmonary shunt,1036,1.566987179,0.496944836,0.7432,0.73214,0.6609,0.8038,0.62247,0.64943,0.769,0.7153,0.652,None,No,High,Yes,USA,Multicenter,-0.188219254,-0.706970429,0,Retrospective review,https://doi.org/10.1109/BIBM.2015.7359777,Paywall
104,"Rodrigues, 2014","Pectus excavatum is the most common deformity of the thorax. Pre-operative diagnosis usually includes Computed Tomography (CT) to successfully employ a thoracic prosthesis for anterior chest wall remodeling. Aiming at the elimination of radiation exposure, this paper presents a novel methodology for the replacement of CT by a 3D laser scanner (radiation-free) for prosthesis modeling. The complete elimination of CT is based on an accurate determination of ribs position and prosthesis placement region through skin surface points. The developed solution resorts to a normalized and combined outcome of an artificial neural network (ANN) set. Each ANN model was trained with data vectors from 165 male patients and using soft tissue thicknesses (STT) comprising information from the skin and rib cage (automatically determined by image processing algorithms). Tests revealed that ribs position for prosthesis placement and modeling can be estimated with an average error of 5.0 +/- 3.6mm. One also showed that the ANN performance can be improved by introducing a manually determined initial STT value in the ANN normalization procedure (average error of 2.82 +/- 0.76 mm). Such error range is well below current prosthesis manual modeling (approximately 11 mm), which can provide a valuable and radiation-free procedure for prosthesis personalization.",Neural network,NN,Decision Support,General Surgery,Pectus excavatum,165,13.55,0,0.90448,0.88803,0.883,0.81231,0.91829,0.8905,0.6259,0.97058,0.8827,Cross-validation,No,Low,Yes,Portugal,Hospital,-0.214577243,1.114105634,0,Retrospective review,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.medengphy.2014.06.020,Paywall
105,"Azimi, 2014","OBJECT: Artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be used as a measure for the clinical decision-making process. The aim of this study was to develop an ANN model to predict endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) success at 6 months and to compare the findings with those obtained using traditional predictive measures in childhood hydrocephalus. METHODS: The ANN, ETV Success Score (ETVSS), CURE Children's Hospital of Uganda (CCHU) ETV (CCHU ETV) Success Score, and logistic regression models were applied to predict outcomes. The cause of hydrocephalus, patient age, whether choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) was performed, previous shunt surgery, sex, type of hydrocephalus, and body weight were considered as input variables for an established ANN model. Data from hydrocephalic children who underwent ETV were applied, and the computer program that analyzes the data was trained to predict successful ETV by using several input variables. Successful ETV outcome was defined as the absence of ETV failure within 6 months of follow-up. Then, sensitivity analysis was performed for the established ANN model to identify the most important variables that predict outcome. The area under a receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy rate of the prediction, and Hosmer-Lemeshow statistics were measured to test different prediction models. RESULTS: Data for 168 patients (80 males and 88 females; mean age 1.4 +/- 2.6 years) were analyzed. Data from patients were divided into 3 groups: a training group (n = 84), a testing group (n = 42), and a validation group (n = 42). The successful ETV outcome rate, defined as the absence of ETV failure within 6 months of follow-up, was 47%. Etiology, age, CPC status, type of hydrocephalus, and previous shunt placement were the most important variables that were indicated by the ANN analysis. Compared with the ETVSS, CCHU ETV Success Score, and the logistic regression models, the ANN model showed better results, with an accuracy rate of 95.1%, a Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic of 41.2, and an area under the curve of 0.87. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show that ANNs can predict ETV success at 6 months with a high level of accuracy in childhood hydrocephalus.

This study proposes an effective technique for measuring a fracture angle in digital scan images taken on the personal computer. This approach is particularly promising in the context of find the angle of the fracture because of the high level of children needed in such accuracy in calculation of the fracture angle to fix it. Our goal is accurate detection of fracture angle. In this paper, we present a strategy based on advances in automatic interpretation of images applied to X-ray images scanned in situ. We propose a cognitive vision system that combines image processing, learning and knowledge based techniques with an advance algorithm to solve the problem. This system is illustrated with automatic detection and calculating Cubitus varus deformity at an early stage. We have compared our approach with manual calculation methods and our results showed that automatic processing is reliable.

An ANN based on quick propagation architecture was created with the commercially available software package. The patients' age and sex, the cause and grade of VUR, the affected ureter, the type of treatment (conservative, subureteric injection, or open surgery), existence of renal scar on DMSA, follow-up times and the number of injections were used as variables. These data were also transferred to a statistical software package and regression analysis was done. RESULTS: In all, 105 UU showed no reflux, 5 UU showed improvements in reflux grade (considered only in the conservative management group), and the remaining 35 UU showed persistence. In the training group (n = 99), ANN showed 98.5% sensitivity, 92.5% specificity, 97% positive predictive value, and 96% negative predictive value in predicting treatment outcome.

In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of a neural network model to predict a delayed decrease of serum creatinine in pediatric kidney recipients. The neural network was constructed with a training set of pediatric kidney recipients (n = 107) by using 20 input variables and assuming for the output variable, the time after 3 days to reach a serum creatinine level 50% below that before kidney transplantation. In the final model, the following input variables showing higher predictive values were retained: serum creatinine on day 1 post transplant, urine volume in the first 24 hours, diagnostic category, pretransplant dialysis mode, patient sex, donor sex, body weight on day 1 posttransplant, and patient age. The model was validated in a second set of patients (n = 41) by blinding the network for the output variable. The overall accuracies of the neural network for the training set, the validation set, and the whole patient cohort were 89.1%, 76.92%, and 87.14%, respectively.

Therefore, we have performed gene expression profiling using cDNA microarrays containing 42,578 clones and used artificial neural networks to develop an accurate predictor of survival for each individual patient with neuroblastoma. Using principal component analysis we found that neuroblastoma tumors exhibited inherent prognostic specific gene expression profiles. Subsequent artificial neural network-based prognosis prediction using expression levels of all 37,920 good-quality clones achieved 88% accuracy.

Since they may be trained to recognize the relevance of complex patterns in data, neural networks may be useful for decision making in the multifactorial management of ureteropelvic junction obstruction. We determine the ability of a customized neural network to predict sonographic outcome after pyeloplasty in children with ureteropelvic junction obstruction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A data set was constructed with 242 demographic, clinical, radiological and surgical elements. We analyzed the available retrospective data in 100 consecutive children who underwent unilateral pyeloplasty for ureteropelvic junction obstruction chosen from all 144 surgically treated for ureteropelvic junction obstruction between 1993 and 1995. One radiologist reviewed all film data and provided a final sonographic outcome designation in each case. We wrote a set of computer programs to construct a neural network. A composite 4-layer network was built with output nodes representing 4 possible sonographic outcomes. The 100 patient data set was randomly divided into 84 training and 16 testing examples. RESULTS: The neural network correctly predicted all 5 of 5 significantly improved, 7 of 7 improved, 2 of 2 same and 2 of 2 worse sonogram results after pyeloplasty. Therefore, sensitivity and specificity were 100% for all 4 outcomes. Linear regression analysis of the data yielded inferior sensitivity and specificity values (52 to 94%), confirming that ureteropelvic junction obstruction is a nonlinear data analysis problem.
